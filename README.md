## Made this to easily fix the drm in Helium on my own computers
It downloads the latest stable Chrome .deb, extracts the widevine component from it and copies it to your Helium directory.


### Tested on
- Fedora 43
- CachyOS

If you give me your helium directories on your weird ass OS, I'll update it to work for you too :D
